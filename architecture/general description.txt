    After login it has to show many controls and information. Some of them are: 
    1.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant.
    1.b. A button to ingest a new data set 
      with the option to ingest from excel file or from csv files (or pasting the csv file as text into a text field) and identify which tables is from the three tables that I will mention later on.
    1.c. A square that says load current data
      and has three button in it to load data from a excel file in /current , that has the three tables in its sheets. Needs to identify for each sheet which table is, or if none. And if is a table, load into the database. When pressing buton "load patients data" loads only the table patients, when pressing in load taxos loads only taxinomies table, and when pressing load brackens results loads only bracken table.
    1.d. A button to proceed to the data showing and preprocessing module/page.
      It shoul be grayed until the three databases are loaded, from the current folder or from the ingest data button.

  2. Data showing and preprocessing module.
    There it has many controls: 
    2.a. A square with infomation of the sample: 
      count, media of duration variable, how many got to the event as percentage and as count, how many are undefined and how many havent arrived to the event, and you can add whatever other info you consider relevant. Updated when the table below is modified.
    2.b. Next to that square it has to have a button to save the resulting view
      (and the generated results if it was already calculated) that includes the edited/filtered/sorted dataset from the table and all the parameters on all the controls(2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 2.f, 2.g) , for later use in the user's data library. And a combobox to load any saved view. And in that combo box, next to each view, a button to delete it (with confirmation).
    2.c. A set of on/off buttons to define if uses also the optional sets of columns
      as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, demographics, disease_characteristics, FISH indicators, comorbidities, and other sets of data. That data groups are in a list in config.py under the comment # column_group, that is already provided in the project. But you can modify that if you think that is necessary. Just modify them to the config.py file.
    
    2.c.1. Advanced Grouping Strategy Selector
      Below the column set selectors (2.c), add a single-selection option group with the following choices:
      - None (default): Perform standard multivariate analysis on all selected variables together

SECTION: Internal working of the web app

  1- Regarding handling users: 
    It needs to have google authentication and user management
      with sessions isolation and multiple users simultaneity. The users have many fields for each of them, like text annotations, saved views (all its parameters as a json file), saved filtered or edited data sources (as a csv file), and saved results (as a comprehensive pdf report). Those saved are stored in storage folders and the user table has a list of dictionaries to them (type, name, file path, date of creation). A user can share any saved result to any other user that receives the save with the text (from xxx) added to the save name, where xxx is the name of the sender. If a result is not saved in any user, its file can be deleted. It would be nice to show the updated google profile photo next to the user on the top right. Also that clicking on the user it drops down a list with information and tools for the user, including managing the annotations, saves, etc. Be creative on that.

        with a Patient_ID, a duration_variable, an event_indicator and many other fields.
      I will provide the name
        of the id field, the name of the duration variable and the name of the event variable in a config.py file under the comment # field_names Check it.
    source_b. Taxonomies table.
      I have a table of taxonomies clasifications
        (taxonomy_id ASV Taxonomy Domain Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species) that might be used to filtering.  
    source_c. Bracken table.
      I have a table with brackens results
        that has a column with the taxonomy_id, and 3 columns for each patient_id in patients, named with the text in patient_id plus an posfix: '.2.4M' means the sample they took from the patient 24 months after the start of treatment, '.P' means the results of the sample they took previous to the treatment and '.E' is a sample they took 2 months after the start of the treatment. And each cell has the results of the sample of that patient at that time for that taxonomy. That is the bracken table. I want to create auxiliary tables: 

  3- Regarding the working data: 
    With this we generate different tables each time the sources are modified:
    data_group_a. 
      A group of 6 tables that generated from bracken
        that has the column patient_id and one column for each taxonomy, that has the value of: for table bracken_pre the value of the '.P' columns. for the table bracken_during the values of the '.E' columns, for the table bracken_pos the values of the '.2.4M' columns, for the table bracken_delta_01 the values of the column '.E' minus the column '.P', for the table bracken_delta_02 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.E', for the table bracken_delta_03 the values of the column '.2.4M' minus the column '.P'.
    data_group_b.
      A group of tables, one for each column groups in config.py as mentioned in 2.c.
        (as used in 2.c, with the name of the table as the name of the group.
    data_group_c. 
      The table of patients

  4- Regarding the data processing:
    CRITICAL: Model Validation and Scientific Rigor Framework
    Before any data processing, implement comprehensive validation:
    - Model assumptions testing (proportional hazards, linearity, independence)
    - Residual analysis and diagnostic plots
    - Influence diagnostics and outlier detection
    - Cross-validation with proper survival data handling (time-dependent)
    - Bootstrap validation with bias-corrected confidence intervals
    - Model calibration assessment (Brier score, calibration plots)
    - Harrell's C-index with confidence intervals and comparison tests
    - Integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI)
    - Decision curve analysis for clinical utility assessment

    Standard Processing (when "None" grouping is selected):
    Replace all the NA and invalid values in all fields but duration
    Try to get info for the duration event if NA or invalid,
      as mentioned in the pop up in the alert in 2.h.
    Merge the tables selected in the selector in 2.c.
      with the table patients, matching patient_id field.
    If a bracken is selected, merge it also with the selected one from 2.d. 
      Use the threshold value (percentual or count) in 2.d. If count, round to 0 the bracken values that are below the count threshold. If proportion, round to 0 the ones below the percentage of the max value for that column
    Select from that table only the patients
      that are in the edges of duration as selected by the slider for percentages in 2.e.
    Do clustering using the parameters in 2.g. to all the columns.
      The parameters to select the name of the cluster is: If there is a column from table patients, or demographics, or disease characteristics, or FISH indicators, or comorbidities, or taxos. Look for it in that order, the name of the cluster is that column. If there is more than one column from the group, select the one using the criteria in 3.d.1.
    Do the selected multivariate analysis method
    Present the results
    
    Advanced Grouping Processing (when specific grouping strategy is selected):
    Follow the same initial data cleaning and merging steps as standard processing, then:
    
    4.1. Group Definition and Validation:
      - Apply the selected grouping strategy from GROUPING_STRATEGIES configuration
      - Validate group composition and check for overlapping variables
      - Calculate group-specific prevalence and missing data patterns
      - Identify rare events within groups and apply pooling strategies
      - Create group-level summary variables and counts
    
    4.2. Within-Group Analysis:
      - Perform univariate analysis for each variable within its group
      - Calculate group-specific correlation matrices and clustering
      - Apply group-appropriate missing data imputation strategies
      - Conduct group-level feature selection and dimensionality reduction
      - Generate group-specific risk scores and composite variables
    
    4.3. Group-Level Modeling:
      - Fit separate multivariate models for each group using group-appropriate methods
      - Apply hierarchical modeling when groups have natural nested structure
      - Use pathway-based constraints for biologically-defined groups
      - Implement stratified analysis for demographic and clinical groups
      - Perform temporal analysis for treatment-related groups
    
    4.4. Cross-Group Analysis:
      - Compare effect sizes and statistical significance across groups
      - Test for group-level interactions and effect modification
      - Perform meta-analysis across groups when appropriate
      - Calculate group-specific model performance metrics (C-index, AIC, BIC)
      - Assess clinical relevance and importance ranking of groups
    
    4.5. Integrated Results Generation:
      - Combine group-specific results into unified risk prediction models
      - Generate hierarchical risk stratification incorporating all groups
      - Create clinical decision algorithms based on group findings

  5- Regarding rules to apply in all the project.
    5.a. add comments to everything in the code
    5.b. add a logging agent and log everything in a log file
    5.c. data is scoped by dataset ownership (via `datasets` table),
      that is each user can create or select one of their datasets (a dataset groups patients, taxonomies and bracken results) and process it in isolation from others.
    5.d. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments # column_names_mapping
      to rename the columns names for the source patients table and the source taxonomy table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.e. Use the definitions in config.py under the comments # identification_fields
    to recognize the columns names for the source patients table. If it doesn't match use fuzzy method to asign each column.
    5.f. For all the taxonomies handling we use the id.
      But in all the presentation on the page it needs to show the taxo name, not the id. 
      All taxos that are shown in the web app should show a popup with the taxo data when hovering on it 0.3 seconds)

  6- Regarding other auxiliary functions
    I will set in config.py 
      the expected column names for table patients and for table taxonomies. For table brackens it should have columns named as the patients id with the posfixes mentioned in 2.c. If the posfix don't match use fuzzy methods to identify them. The patient_id must match exactly.
    This project should be placed in a pythonanywhere account. Make it ready for that.
    This should be done using 
      flask, pandas, numpy, sklearn, lifelines, plotly, and any other library that you consider relevant. Use bootstrap or any other library to make the web app pretty and easy to use.
    All the code should be in a github repository
      that I can access. I will provide the repository link.
    All the controls and elements in the page
      should have a explanatory text next to it or in a popup after 1 second of hovering
    Add a page with a tutorial, 
      that is a extensive, detailed, precise explanation of everything that this webapp does in a technical but not so formal language. The target is scientifics that specializes on biomedicine and cancer treatment but don't know so much about mathmatics. Explain all the methods used to process the data, the algorithms used for clustering the methods for analysis and its differences, and how to interpret the results. It is a tutorial for the beginner to use this webapp.
