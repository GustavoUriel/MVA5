### 2601221230 - Fix stray text in metadata/COLUMNS.py

Change performed:

- Commented out stray plaintext lines at the end of `metadata/COLUMNS.py` that
  were left in the module and caused syntax issues. The comments preserve the
  original antibiotic group notes for reference.

Files modified:

- `metadata/COLUMNS.py` — trailing plaintext lines converted to comments.

Summary:

Minimal, least-invasive fix: commented the accidental plain-text notes
containing antibiotic groups/examples to restore module validity while
preserving the original notes for future reference.

End of log.
