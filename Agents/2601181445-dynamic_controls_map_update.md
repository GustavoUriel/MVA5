# 2601181445-dynamic_controls_map_update.md

## Update Summary

- Appended all possible dynamic controls for each analysis method to metadata\temp\map.txt.
- Controls were enumerated based on JS logic in app/static/js/dataset_analysis.js and backend schemas.
- Each analysis method now lists its specific dynamic controls (e.g., parameters, selects, options) in the map.

## Details

- Controls for methods such as Cox Proportional Hazards, AFT, Competing Risks, Frailty Model, Gradient Boosting, Kaplan-Meier, Log-Rank, RSF, and RMST are now included.
- This ensures the map.txt file is comprehensive, covering both static and dynamic UI elements.

## Final Summary

All dynamic controls for analysis methods are now mapped in metadata\temp\map.txt. The mapping task is complete and fully documented.
