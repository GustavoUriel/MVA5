# 2601211200-add_pros_cons_to_clustering_methods.md

## Changes Made
- Added 'pros', 'cons', 'limitations', and 'expectations' fields to each clustering method in CLUSTERING_METHODS.py
- Each field contains a list of relevant points for better understanding of each method's characteristics

## Summary
Enhanced the clustering methods configuration with detailed pros, cons, limitations, and expectations to help users make informed decisions about which clustering algorithm to use for their data analysis. All six clustering methods (no_clustering, hierarchical, kmeans, dbscan, gaussian_mixture, spectral) now include comprehensive evaluation criteria.
